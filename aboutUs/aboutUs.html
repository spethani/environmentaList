        <p>Hey! I’m Danielle, I am 13 years and I am from New York City. Although I have done coding in the past it was at a very beginner level. Only recently at Kode With Klossy (a coding bootcamp) I have started learning Javascript, CSS and most importantly HTML. With my new coding skills I am able to program/code websites.
          In EnvironmentaList I am in charge of Research and Coding!
          Before beginning this project I never really thought about the impacts of CO2. Recently I have been seeing many articles and posts saying saying that at this rate we may not survive till 2050. This honestly scared me a lot. This is why I am, along with Daniela and Sarah, creating this website to inform others on the issue and why we should take stance.</p>

        <p>Hello! My name is Daniela, I am 17 years old and I’m from Mexico. I’ve been studying coding for a little over a year now (mostly Python 2) and recently I have been learning HTML, JavaScript and CSS in the Kode With Klossy Summer Camp!
        In EnvironmentaList I’m in charge of Social Media Managing and also coding!!
        I have been interested in gardening and working for the environment since I was young, yet I never really acted up on it until recently. Seeing how the ecological crisis is affecting my everyday life and the politics of my country is extremely important for me and I believe this feeling should be shared with others! This is why Danielle, Sarah and I have created the EnvironmentaList website!
        We want to create a space where people can learn more about their country’s policy and what they can do in order to make the current situation better!</p>

        <p>Hello! My name is Sarah, I am 17 years old and I am from Long Island City. I recently was accepted into Carnegie Mellon’s School of Computer Science.
          This is my second year attending Kode with Klossy’s Web Development camp. In EnvironmentaList, I am the head of the Coding team!
          Before this project, I had heard about the deteriorating state of our environment. However, when learning about it in science classes and through the news, it’s hard to visual as an imminent threat to our lives. For this reason, I was interested in creating a website to show the jarring statistics of how countries are contributing to the slow destruction of our environment.</p>

    <h1>Our Mission</h1>
    <div class="mission">
      <p>Our mission is to inform people of all ages about the climate crisis.
        Although our website is for anybody to visit we are targeting young adults or new voters since they contribute to a minor percentage of the vote. All three of us have a passion for the climate and climate change because it is basically our future. If we don't change now, we won’t be able to change later. Now is the time,  reduce, reuse, recycle!</p>
